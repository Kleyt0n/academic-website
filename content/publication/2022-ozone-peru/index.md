abstract: The main objective of this study is to model the concentration of ozone in the winter season on air quality through machine learning algorithms, detecting its impact on population health. The study area involves four monitoring stations Ate, San Borja, Santa Anita and Campo de Marte, all located in Metropolitan Lima during the years 2017, 2018 and 2019. Exploratory, correlational and predictive approaches are presented. The exploratory results showed that ATE is the station with the highest prevalence of ozone pollution. Likewise, in an hourly scale analysis, the pollution peaks were reported at 00:00 and 14:00. Finally, the machine learning models that showed the best predictive capacity for
