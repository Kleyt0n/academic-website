As the first year of my master's in computer science at PUC-Rio comes to an end, I decided to share some thoughts on how this process has been so far. When choosing a master's or doctoral program, it is important to consider the credentials of the institution. In the case of the computer science field in Brazil, the [Department of Informatics at PUC-Rio](https://www.inf.puc-rio.br/en/) stands out not only for its pioneering spirit (having created the [first](https://www.inf.puc-rio.br/blog/noticia/noticia/criacao-da-primeira-pos-graduacao-em-computacao-no-brasil) graduate program in Computer Science in the country in 1967) but also for the excellence with which it has maintained the program over the years. This is evident in the fact that since the beginning of the [CAPES](https://sucupira.capes.gov.br/sucupira/public/consultas/coleta/programa/quantitativos/quantitativoPrograma.xhtml?areaAvaliacao=2&areaConhecimento=10300007&cdRegiao=0&ies=4269) evaluation, the program has consistently received the highest rating (7). Moreover, the program boasts a faculty composed of researchers who generate cutting-edge knowledge in various areas of computer science.

### Summary of the first year 

In the first semester, incoming students undergo a "challenge" called Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA). This course is mandatory for first-semester students and covers various topics related to the asymptotic analysis of algorithm complexity, i.e., understanding how the complexity of an algorithm behaves in relation to the size of the input. The course also introduces a set of algorithms that must be implemented in different scenarios and with different data structures, such as sorting algorithms, graph search algorithms, dynamic programming, and more. All topics are explored in depth, and students are challenged to create pseudo-codes for non-trivial problems. Undoubtedly, it was an enriching experience, especially in my case, as I transitioned from economics to computer science without a BSc in computer science.

In addition to DAA, I took two other courses: Software Engineering for Data Science and Academic Writing. The first course covers software engineering concepts applied to data science, such as the use of automated testing, code versioning, code documentation, design patterns, and more. The second course focuses on academic writing techniques, including writing scientific articles, conducting literature reviews, presenting academic papers, and more. Despite having some experience developing software projects and writing articles, these courses helped me systematize certain concepts that I applied in my daily routine more automatically.

In the second semester, I took three more courses that have been very useful in my research and work: (i) optimization algorithms; (ii) computational geometry; and (iii) information visualization. In optimization, the focus was on implementing algorithms for nonlinear problems with and without constraints. We applied gradient descent, Newton-Raphson, Fletcher-Reeves, BFGS, among others. In computational geometry, the focus was on implementing algorithms for computational geometry problems, such as the problem of finding the convex hull of a set of points. Finally, in information visualization, the focus was on the implementation and conceptual evaluation of data visualization techniques.

### Some projects

These are some of the projects I developed throughout the first year of my master's program. I plan to enhance them over the coming months and am also open to contributions.
